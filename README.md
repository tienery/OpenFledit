# OpenFledit
A visual editor for designing scenes and interfaces with OpenFL. This project is in very early stages and currently unusable. If you wish to contribute, you can do. Most of the progress of this project on my side of things will include videos in a similar format to RPGFL (a now discontinued project).

For continued development, please support the project by donating [here](https://www.patreon.com/tienery?ty=h).
