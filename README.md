# OpenFledit
A visual editor for designing scenes and interfaces with OpenFL.

This project is in very early development.

Currently, you can only drag bitmaps and text onto the screen.

I am currently looking for someone to take over this project as I have lost interest. Please message me on Github for further information.

## Planned

 1. To add a Property Box to modify and change the appearance and behaviour of objects at runtime.
 2. To add support for dragging SimpleButtons, Sprites, and reusable components onto the screen.
 3. The ability to generate the Haxe code into a file, including imports, variable declaration, construction and adding children.

## Contributing

To contribute, you will need the following libraries before you can begin:

  1. OpenFL and Lime
  2. [Linc Dialogs](https://github.com/snowkit/linc_dialogs) - or `haxelib git linc_dialogs https://github.com/snowkit/linc_dialogs`
  3. `msignal` - `haxelib install msignal`
